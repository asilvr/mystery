# Contributing

The main contributions needed are to the ingredients dataset. We want to
provide an ever growing list of quality, locally sourced ingredients. If you
feel like you have a good ingredient to add, please create a pull request and
add it. If you want to contribute, but don't have a package in mind, a good
place to start is by searching Google for "awesome {LANGUAGE}" for a repo of
awesome projects in a language.

- Go ([go.json](./datasets/go.json))
- Swift ([swift.json](./datasets/swift.json))

If you want to add a new language support, we are also accepting pull requests
for that. You can compare to the existing languages that are supported to see
what contributions are needed to support a language.

More specific examples of how to contribute will be added here soon. If you are
unsure if your contribution is appropriate, feel free to reach out or make a
pull request and we can review it!
